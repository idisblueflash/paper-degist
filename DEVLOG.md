# Dev log — deferred flags to revisit

Small, non-blocking issues noticed during development. Each names the code
location, the case not yet handled, and the trigger that should make us fix it.

## parse_url — trailing-punctuation stripping is heuristic

- **Where:** `src/paper_degist/parse_url.py` (`_URL_RE` + `rstrip(".,;")`).
- **Case not handled:** the regex captures up to whitespace or `)`, then strips
  trailing `.,;`. This is correct for URLs that end a sentence, but would wrongly
  strip a trailing `.`/`;`/`,` that is a *real* path or query character. Markdown
  links wrapped in `<...>` and URLs containing a legitimate closing `)` are also
  not handled.
- **Trigger to fix:** the first time a real input URL ends in one of these chars,
  or a `manifest.jsonl` entry shows a mangled URL. Add a failing scenario/unit
  test with that URL, then tighten the regex.
- **Status:** RESOLVED (PR #1 review). `_URL_RE` now matches generously
  (angle-brackets excluded, `re.IGNORECASE`, left-boundary lookbehind against
  embedded schemes) and `_trim_trailing` strips prose punctuation plus only
  *unbalanced* wrapper parens, so `paper_(v2).pdf` survives while `[t](url)`
  loses its wrapper. Balanced-paren, mixed-case, and embedded-scheme cases are
  pinned by unit tests. One residual heuristic remains: a trailing `.` after a
  path (`.../a.`) is still treated as sentence punctuation and stripped — an
  accepted policy, documented by `test_strips_trailing_prose_punctuation_*`.

## parse_url CLI — console entry point (`main`) is not unit-tested

- **Where:** `src/paper_degist/parse_url.py::main`, `src/tests/test_parse_url.py`.
- **Case not handled:** tests exercise `parse_url()` directly; `main([...])`,
  stdin input, one-URL-per-line stdout formatting, and error exit codes are
  unguarded. Deferred by the writer in PR #1 review ("let's not touch this from
  now, consider later").
- **Trigger to fix:** when CLI error handling lands (see the open discussion on
  a file-handling package below), or the first CLI-behavior regression. Add
  `main`/stdin tests via `capsys`/`monkeypatch` plus a missing-file case then.
- **Status:** open (deferred, by request).
